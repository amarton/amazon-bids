          <p>The Seattle-based Internet commerce behemoth is considering building a massive second base that would create 50,000 new jobs with average pay in excess of $100,000. Jurisdictions across the country — including Baltimore, Columbia and Prince George’s County — are getting ready to engage in a bidding war.</p>
          <p>Amazon is encouraging states and metropolitan areas to coordinate and submit one bid for an entire region. The bid can “contain multiple real estate sites” but the company encourages local and state governments to focus on the best option.</p>
          <p>Key city and state officials are now focusing on attempting to lure the company to Port Covington in South Baltimore, where Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank is planning a $5.5 billion development that will be home of a new campus for the nation's No. 2 sports apparel company.</p>
          <p>Plank’s Sagamore Development Co. also plans restaurants, shops, housing and manufacturing space at the 260-acre site, which is also home of The Baltimore Sun’s printing press. The Sun has a long-term lease on the facility.</p>
          <p>Sagamore officials have been meeting with government leaders to shore up support for the site.</p>
          <p>But does Baltimore have the environment needed to win the Amazon bid? Below we compare the criteria the company put forth in its request for proposals with what the city has to offer.</p>

          <p class="chatter">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson metro area ranks 167 in the U.S. in terms of unemployment rates for metropolitan areas. Maryland ranks 18th out of U.S. states for unemployment. Maryland’s unemployment rate is 3.9 percent. The national rate is 4.4 percent.</p><img src="images/unemployment.png">

        <div class="container__text">
          <p>After years of job losses, Baltimore’s economy has stabilized and is improving. According to state labor statistics, the city has added about 18,000 jobs over the past five years, while unemployment has dropped from 10.9 percent to 6.2 percent.</p>
          <p>Maryland’s unemployment rate is 3.9 percent. The national rate is 4.4 percent.</p>
          <p>Whether the city is “business-friendly” is a different question. Baltimore’s property tax rate is more than double the rest of Maryland and the city charges some fees, such as a bottle tax, that are either much higher than other jurisdictions or don’t exist elsewhere.</p>
          <p>That said, the city has cut special deals with certain businesses that give them a highly advantageous tax rate, such as the $1 annual property tax charged to the Marriott Waterfront Hotel in Harbor East. When Amazon opened a warehouse in Southeast Baltimore several years ago, city and state officials offered more than $43 million in subsidies. So, the company has chosen to go into business here before.</p>
          <p>Amazon’s request for bids states that special deals like those are desired: “Incentives offered by the state/province and local communities to offset initial capital outlay and ongoing operational costs will be significant factors in the decision-making process.”</p>
          <p>“We’re really competing against other metro areas,” said William H. Cole IV, the president of the Baltimore Development Corp. “We show very favorable in terms of cost of business and cost of living.”</p>

          <p>About one-third of Baltimore residents have a college degree, as do 43 percent of Baltimore County residents. The area is also home to more than a dozen universities and colleges, including the highly competitive Johns Hopkins University. The Baltimore-Towson-Columbia metro area combined to rank No. 18 on the national list of most educated cities, as compiled by WalletHub.com.</p>
          <p>The city, however, has struggled for years to retain population, while the suburbs have grown. Last year, Baltimore lost an estimated 6,000 residents.</p>

        <div class="container__text">
          <p>How Baltimore fares on this criterion will likely depend on the level of creativity in the city’s bid. Baltimore officials have worked on major development projects in the past, including helping build Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Harborplace and the planned Port Covington redevelopment.</p>
          <p>Cole said dozens of people in city, state and local governments — as well as the private sector — are working on the Port Covington bid. City officials have already approved public financing for infrastructure there — a $660 million tax-increment-financing (TIF) deal. Under such deals, the city issues bonds to pay for project infrastructure and then pays them off using new revenue generated by property taxes on the development. It’s expected to take 40 years to pay off those bonds.</p>
          <p>“The TIF is in place. It’s ready to go. If that’s not a demonstration that we are prepared, I don’t know what is,” Cole said.</p>

          <p>At Port Covington, state and city officials are planning to build a $165 million light rail extension to the site. The public financing deal with the city also funds an “internal rail circulator,” and Port Covington's bike path is being built using a material that will absorb sunlight and “emit a glow at night.”</p>
          <p>State officials also are applying for a $76 million federal grant for an I-95 interchange project at the site.</p>

The travel website Atlas Obscura has called Baltimore America's most eccentric city, citing Edgar Allan Poe's grave site and being the place where the Ouija board was named, among other factors.</p>
          <p>Zagat has ranked Baltimore as high as No. 2 on its list of best food cities. And Entrepreneur magazine has named Baltimore second on a list of "Hot Startup Cities That Aren't San Francisco or New York," emphasizing its concentration of companies working in the education field.</p>
          <p>The area offers cheaper housing than nearby Washington. And state officials have approved a $1.1 billion investment to renovate and upgrade the city’s public school buildings.</p>
          <p>“The city has so many really incredible neighborhoods,” Cole said. “We have an arts and culture community that has such a vibrancy. We have increasing numbers in our sports and social leagues. Our diversity is one of our strong suits.
