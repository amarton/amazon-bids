					p The Seattle-based Internet commerce behemoth is considering building a massive second base that would create 50,000 new jobs with average pay in excess of $100,000. Jurisdictions across the country — including Baltimore and Prince George’s County — are getting ready to engage in a bidding war.
					p Amazon is encouraging states and metropolitan areas to coordinate and submit one bid for an entire region. The bid can “contain multiple real estate sites” but the company encourages local and state governments to focus on the best option.
					p Key city and state officials are now focusing on attempting to lure the company to Port Covington in South Baltimore, where Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank is planning a $5.5 billion development that will be home of a new campus for the nation's No. 2 sports apparel company. Plank’s Sagamore Development Co. also plans restaurants, shops, housing and manufacturing space. The site is home of The Baltimore Sun’s printing press. The Sun has a long-term lease on the facility.
					p Sagamore officials have been meeting with government leaders to shore up support for the site.
					p But does Baltimore have the environment needed to win the Amazon bid? Below we compare the criteria the company put forth in its request for proposals with what the city has to offer.

					p.chatter According to the bureau of labor statistics, the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson metro area ranks 167 in the U.S. in terms of unemployment rates for metropolitan areas. Maryland ranks 18th out of U.S. states for unemployment. Maryland’s unemployment rate is 3.9 percent. The national rate is 4.4 percent.

					p After years of job losses, Baltimore’s economy has stabilized and is improving. According to state labor statistics, the city has added about 18,000 jobs over the past five years, while unemployment has dropped from 10.9 percent to 6.2 percent.
					p.subhead 
					p Whether the city is “business-friendly” is a different question. Baltimore’s property tax rate is more than double the rest of Maryland and the city charges some fees, such as a bottle tax, that are either much higher than other jurisdictions or don’t exist elsewhere.
					p That said, the city has cut special deals with certain businesses that give them a highly advantageous tax rate, such as the $1 annual property tax charged to the Marriott Waterfront Hotel in Harbor East. When Amazon opened a warehouse in Southeast Baltimore several years ago, city and state officials offered up more than $43 million in subsidies.
					p Amazon’s request for bids states that special deals like those are desired: “Incentives offered by the state/province and local communities to offset initial capital outlay and ongoing operational costs will be significant factors in the decision-making process.”

					p About one-third of Baltimore residents has a college degree, while 43 percent of Baltimore County residents do. The area is also home to many universities and colleges, including the highly competitive Johns Hopkins University. The Baltimore-Towson-Columbia metro area combined to rank No. 18 on the national list of most educated cities, as compiled by WalletHub.com.
					p The city, however, has struggled for years to retain population, while the suburbs have grown. Last year, Baltimore lost an estimated 6,000 residents.

					p Depending on the site in Baltimore, both of these preferences could be accommodated — through the light rail, subway or bus system — although the death of the planned East-West Red Line light rail limits the locations where Amazon could build. However, Baltimore does have a free downtown bus called the Charm City Circulator, and Plank’s firm recently upgraded a fleet of water taxis.
					p At Port Covington, state and city officials are planning to build a $165 million light rail extension to the site. A $660 million public financing deal with the city also funds an “internal rail circulator,” and Port Covington's bike path is being built using a material that will absorb sunlight and “emit a glow at night.”

					p Unlike some other cities, available space isn’t necessarily an issue in Baltimore — with some 40,000 vacant properties, the city can accommodate a large corporate campus. While some have argued the best location in Baltimore would be State Center site in Midtown, where the city has already approved tax breaks, officials appear to be coalescing around Plank’s Port Covington development. The city has already green-lighted a massive infrastructure investment there.

					p Baltimore is often known for crime and blight, but there’s much more to the city than that. The travel website Atlas Obscura has called Baltimore America's most eccentric city, citing such factors as Edgar Allan Poe's gravesite and the naming site of the Ouija board. Zagat has named Baltimore as high as No. 2 on its list of best food cities. And Entrepreneur magazine has named Baltimore second on a list of "Hot Startup Cities That Aren't San Francisco or New York," emphasizing its concentration of companies working in the education field.
